Welcome friend’s to Jonathan’s Readme file!

Take your time, explore, stay for margaritas, send money.

Let’s talk data.

You’ll notice as many as six charts on my page! That’s a lot of data visualization. 

For the first chart, I visited our good friends at NASA and downloaded data (https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) and clicked the download data link. From there, I opened the data in excel and created a chart in excel, using the temp high column and the year. I took a screen shot of the chart and uploaded it to the page.

The second chart is a D3 visualization of datasets from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters) and NOAA. Here, I downloaded the data into an excel file and pulled the specific data sets I was looking for into a separate excel page. I created columns for the year and then each weather event I was interested in. I saved that page as a .csv file which I then saved into my directory so I could draw directly from it for the visualization. It was harder than it sounds.

The third chart is from NOAA (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E11.html), still running strong despite a government shutdown and an Administration hostile to the whole “climate thing.” Here, once again I pulled the data into an excel file and made a line chart in excel, which I uploaded as an image.

The fourth chart (floods), fifth chart (droughts), and sixth chart (wildfires) are all from the same data set from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters). For each, I created a line chart in excel and uploaded the image to my page.
