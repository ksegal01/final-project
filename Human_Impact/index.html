<h2>Total Disaster-Related Deaths Worldwide, 1900-2018</h2></div><br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
The graph below shows the total number of deaths associated with droughts, floods, storms, temperature extremes, and wildfires worldwide between 1900 and 2018. These particular disaster types could be exacerbated by climate change in the coming decades. Other non-climate related disasters were reported by the data set but were not included in this particular graph (e.g., volcanoes or earthquakes).
What can we learn from this graph? As climate change impacts intensify, policymakers should be aware that droughts and floods have been responsible historically for more deaths than storms, temperature extremes, or wildfires. Therefore, planning efforts can put more emphasis on drought and flood adaptation and prevention measures to reduce the number of lives lost.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
Regions will differ in their susceptibility to different disasters, so it is crucial to consider regional variations when planning for disaster.
