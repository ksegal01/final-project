<h2>Total Disaster-Related Deaths Worldwide, 1900-2018</h2></div><br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
The graph below shows the total number of deaths associated with droughts, floods, storms, temperature extremes, and wildfires worldwide between 1900 and 2018. These particular disaster types could be exacerbated by climate change in the coming decades. Other non-climate related disasters were reported by the data set but were not included in this particular graph (e.g., volcanoes or earthquakes).<br>
<br>
What can we learn from this graph? As climate change impacts intensify, policymakers should be aware that droughts and floods have been responsible historically for more deaths than storms, temperature extremes, or wildfires. Therefore, planning efforts can put more emphasis on drought and flood adaptation and prevention measures to reduce the number of lives lost.<br>
<br>
Deaths from disasters are less common in recent years possibly because of better adaptation measures, better warning and evacuation systems, and more sophisticated and timely disaster response. This should encourage policymakers that preparation works in reducing human impact.

<!-- See readme_1.txt for more information about data process. Edited Raw EMDAT data using Excel by creating Pivot table, copying and pasting pivot tables as values only, assigning disaster type to each row, and saving as disasters.CSV. Please see "Human Impact" Excel file for intermediate step. It took quite a while to get the data sorted and the visualization running so this is the result of quite a bit of effort. -->

<!-- See readme_2.txt for more information about data process for this map. Did a lot of reading about making maps in various platforms, and decided on Choropleth because felt it was best fit for the data story I'm trying to tell. I have previous experience in Stata, so I spent a couple hours playing with the dataset in Stata and plugging around with Stata's mapping capabilities before deciding that Datawrapper could get me a better output.  -->
<H1> Regional Spotlight: Europe </H1>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
Regions differ in the death tolls they experience from disasters, so policymakers should take into account the specific conditions of their region when preparing for disaster. These regional variations could be due to a variety of factors, including economic disparities (some cities may be better equipped to prepare for the worst), awareness of risk, and pure luck at some level -- who knows where a storm will hit, for example, no matter how much you've prepared. <br>
<br>

The map below displays regional variations in natural disaster related fatalities in Europe between 1980 - 2016. As the map shows, the death toll was highest in France, Italy, and Spain. When planning for disaster adaptations, it is crucial to uncover more details about why these countries experienced more fatalities than others. Perhaps they experienced more disasters, or a few very serious disasters. Or perhaps they lacked early warning systems, escape or evacuation plans, or response capabilities necessary to save the most lives possible. 

Regions will also differ in what types of disasters even occur. For example, if you live in a coastal state, you might be more worried about storm surges or flooding than somewhere more prone While this isn't represented in the data shown below, we recommend keeping this fact in mind during the planning process.

<h1> What types of disasters have occured most frequently?</h1>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  You may be wondering if the greater number of deaths from certain disasters is directly correlated with a higher frequency of those disasters. For example, the chart above indicates that many people have died from drought in the past century or so--is that simply because there have been a lot of droughts? The bar chart below demonstrates that floods are the most common disaster type, which we might expect from the death tally. But it also shows that droughts, which cause many deaths, are the fourth most common disaster type. From this we can infer that when they do occur, droughts have the capacity to do lots of damage. And while storms and earthquakes happen more often than droughts, they haven't resulted in as many deaths over time. Policymakers take note: it would be wise to prepare for floods and droughts because when they do occur, they take many lives. You might be able to save more people by focusing on adaptation measures preparing residents for these heavy-hitting disasters.<br>
