    <h1>Damage by disaster type</h1>

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

    Climate-related natural disasters are causing more economic harm than ever before. In the last decade, disasters have been more costly both in typical years and peak years (years with especially severe disasters like 2005 and 2017). Major storms like Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), Harvey and Maria (both 2017) are especially harmful. In years when they occurred, they accounted for over 80% of global economic damages from climate-related disasters.
