<h1> Rising Temperature has increased Natural Disasters, but do we care?</h1>
</div>


Scientific evidence has shown strong correlation between increasing atmospheric concentration of Carbon Dioxide, rising global temperature, and increasing frequency of natural disasters. Pew Centre conducted a survey to assess the concern around Climate Change, across a number of countries.

Please visit the relevant UN body's <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/"> website </a> to learn more about climate change.

The previous pages on this website have shown the human and financial cost of these rising natural disasters, however, how do people associate climate change and natural disasters?

 <br>
 <br>

A Pew Research Centre Study shows that 44% of respondents associate disasters such as droughts, floods, and unusual weather with climate change. 

 <br>
 <br>

The United States of America has a similar respondents' break up, with droughts being the most associated with climate change, followed by rising sea level and floods. 3% of the respondents denied the existence of climate change.

 <br>
 <br>

This analysis is important as public sentiment feeds into policy drafting. As natural disasters increase with rising temperatures, countries need to become more resilient.

Coming to the broader concept of climate change. Less than half of all Americans are concerned about climate change as a whole. On our analysis of 42 countries, it was found that this concern is not significantly correlated (0.18) with the human impact of natural disasters.


 <br>
 <br>

The graph below shows the percentage of respondents (x-axis), across different countries (y-axis) who are atleast concerned about climate change.

<br>

Our hypothesis is that countries that are more impacted with natural disasters, have citizens that are more concerned about climate change. However, our data analysis between "number of internally displaced persons, due to natural disasters" in a country and "percentage of respondents concerned about climate change" did not yield a significant relationship.
